This directory contains the Python scripts used to generate/load data for molecular Hamiltonian and post-process results for VQPE, UVQPE, and QCELS convergence studies.

### Included Interactive Python Notebooks

- `ODMD_utilities.ipynb` – contains routines for running ODMD 
- `VQPE_utilities.ipynb` – contains routines for running VQPE and UVQPE
- `QCELS_utilities.ipynb` – contains routines for running QCELS
- `compare_methods_spin_Fig5.ipynb` – walks through VQPE, UVQPE, and QCELS calculations for molecular systems, using data either preloaded in this folder or generated via the routines above
