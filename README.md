# Observable Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ODMD)

This repository contains MATLAB and Python implementations of ODMD, a real-time eigensolver for estimating the low-lying eigenenergies and eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians.

For more details, see our paper on [arXiv:2306.01858] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01858).
